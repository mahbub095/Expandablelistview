Special emphasis will be given to the development of reading and writing skills. To ensure maximum benefit from this course, 30% of the total marks will be allotted to class work in reading and writing. Speaking: Students will focus on developing speaking which will include strategies for communication and an acquaintance with phonetics. Effective oral presentation. Tasks will include making statements, requests, inquiries, disagreeing, complaining and apologizing, discussing, and other oral presentations. Listening: Students will practice listening to spoken English and taking useful notes. Reading: Extracts from literary and general essays will be used to develop comprehension as well as an understanding of the nature of literary communication. Students will develop the following reading strategies: Grammar in Use: While grammar will generally be taught in context, some attention to grammar may be necessary a this stage. The following aspects may be taught: articles, verb patterns, sentence combining-subordination and coordination, conditional sentences, the infinitive, gerund, and participle, subject-verb agreement. Writing: Paragraph, précis and analytical writings, writing on current affairs, Scientific writing. Commercial Correspondences: Defining context, feedback and semantic gap. Different types of commercial and business letter writing, tender-notice and pre-qualification notice writing. Writing of different types of reports on specific topics.");
